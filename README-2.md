# FindTheDrift (Working Title)

## 🏁 Project Overview

**FindTheDrift** is a Java-based race simulation system that blends real-world car data, simulated lap performance, and intelligent driving feedback. It was originally inspired by drifting — my personal favorite racing style — but it’s grown into something much bigger.

This project now acts as a **performance coaching tool**, a **race strategy simulator**, and a way to analyze vehicle behavior using live telemetry and AI-style feedback through an in-game racing assistant called **GHOST**.

## 🎮 What It Does

- **Simulates Lap Performance** for real cars like the GT-R R34, Porsche GT3, Ferrari 488, and others.
- Uses **randomized but realistic telemetry**: lap time, throttle, brake force, tire temp, suspension load, etc.
- Implements a **GHOST Coaching System** that analyzes driver behavior and delivers real-time advice.
- Tracks a **Driver Profile** based on average corner speeds and lap history.
- Shows a **dynamic HUD** and ranks lap times on a **Leaderboard**.
- Supports custom part upgrades, tire selections, and grip-to-weight dynamics.

## 🧠 GHOST: The Virtual Racing Coach

GHOST is the intelligent system that “speaks” to the driver using racing-style terms.

Depending on race conditions, it might say:

- *“Brake late, eyes up, nail the exit.”*
- *“You’re in striking range — apply pressure, clean and close.”*
- *“Defend now — clean exit, full traction.”*
- *“Keep it smooth. Wait for the gap.”*

It’s designed to act like a real coach — not robotic — with calm, motivational tips like the kind used in MFG or GT sports anime and pro racing teams.

## 🧪 Code Structure

- `Car.java`: Defines each car’s specs, parts, telemetry data.
- `RaceData.java`: Holds lap-by-lap telemetry values.
- `GhostSystem.java`: Runs the simulation — links car, ECU, track, memory, voice, and mind.
- `GhostMind.java`: Makes race decisions and outputs coaching tips.
- `GhostVoice.java`: Handles speech (text output).
- `GhostMemory.java`: Tracks lap history and driver performance.
- `GhostHUD.java`: Displays live telemetry.
- `Leaderboard.java`: Displays lap rankings.

---

## 🔧 What's Next

- Add driver modes: *SAFE, ATTACK, DEFEND*
- Allow manual part tuning & car upgrades (turbo, suspension, etc.)
- Add fatigue mechanics (tire wear, brake fade)
- Turn this into a GUI or Web App (Spring Boot or React maybe)
- Long-term: integrate with real lap data or sim rigs

## 👨‍💻 Why I Made This

I’m a college student into racing and computer science. I’ve always loved drifting and lap times. I started this to simulate driving behavior — but now I want to push it further:

> **Can a computer system learn the best racing line, and coach any driver to reach it?**

This is just the beginning of a bigger plan — a system that could one day help race teams, sim racers, and part designers unlock peak performance.
